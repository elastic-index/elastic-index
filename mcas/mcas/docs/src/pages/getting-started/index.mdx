MCAS is designed for flexible deployment.  However, it is positioned for
specific network and memory hardware if available.

## Platform Preparation

1. **Operating System** - install one of the following supported distributions:
    - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS x86_64
    - Fedora Core 27, 30 or 32 x86_64
    - RHEL8 x86_64

2. **Mellanox RDMA** - for high-performance MCAS supports Mellanox RDMA network
cards and has been tested with ConnectX-4 and ConnectX-5.  MCAS can operate with
plain TCP/IP sockets, but performance is significantly slower.  Mellanox OFED
(OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution for Linux) distributions can be downloaded
from https://www.mellanox.com/products/infiniband-drivers/linux/mlnx_ofed.
  ```bash
    $ ibdev2netdev
    mlx5_0 port 1 ==> enp216s0f0 (Up)
    mlx5_1 port 1 ==> enp216s0f1 (Up)
  ```

3. **Persistent Memory** - MCAS is designed explicitly for persistent memory.  However,
it can be used with DRAM only (mapstore) or with emulated persistent memory.
Emulated or real persistent memory must be
configured in _device DAX_ mode.  See https://pmem.io/2016/02/22/pm-emulation.html for
information on PM emulation.  Verify availability of devdax PM:
  ```bash
  ls /dev/dax*
  chmod a+rwx /dev/dax*
  ```

## Building MCAS

1. Check out source and update submodules:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/IBM/mcas.git
   cd mcas
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. Install package dependencies. For example:
   ```sh
   cd mcas/deps
   sudo ./install-yum-fc27.sh
   ```

3. Configure cmake build (e.g. release build):
   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DBUILD_KERNEL_SUPPORT=ON -DFLATBUFFERS_BUILD_TESTS=0 -DTBB_BUILD_TESTS=0 -DBUILD_PYTHON_SUPPORT=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=`pwd`/dist ..
   ```

4. Make bootstrap (this only needs to happen once):
   ```sh
   make bootstrap
   ```

5. Perform rest of build (which can be repeated on code change):
   ```sh
   make -j install
   ```
   

## Before running code

MCAS currently requires two custom kernel modules.  One, `xpmem.ko` is needed for the 'mapstore' backend component.  The other, `mcasmod.ko` is needed for the 'hstore' components.  Normmaly, both modules should be loaded into the system after they have been build.

```sh
insmod ./dist/lib/modules/4.18.19-100.fc27.x86_64/xpmem.ko
```

```sh
insmod ./dist/bin/mcasmod.ko
```

**Note**: the _hstore_ backend is preferred.  If you are using the
  _mapstore_ backend, the direct operations (e.g. 'get_direct,
  put_direct) that perform zero-copy DMA transfers will not work.

## Running an example

### Launch MCAS server

The MCAS server can be launched from the build directory.  Using one of the pre-supplied (testing) configuration files:

```bash
./dist/bin/mcas --conf ./dist/testing/mapstore-0.conf
```

This configuration file defines a single shard, using port 11911 on the `mlx5_0` RDMA NIC adapter.

Note, ```./dist``` is the location of the installed distribution.

### Launch the Python client

Again, from the build directory:

```bash
./dist/bin/mcas-shell
```

First open a session to the MCAS server:

```python
session = mcas.Session(ip='10.0.0.101', port=11911)
```

Next create a pool. Provide pool name, size of pool in bytes and expected number of objects (presizes hash table):

```python
pool = session.create_pool('pool0', 64*1024, 1000)
```

Now we can create key-value pairs:

```python
pool.put('myPet','doggy')
```

And then retrieve the value back:

```python
pool.get('myPet')
```

We can configure a volatile index for the pool.  This allows us to perform scans on the key space - find_key(expression, offset).

```python
pool.configure("AddIndex::VolatileTree")
pool.find_key('regex:.*', 0)
```

Finally, the pool can be closed.

```python
pool.close()
```
