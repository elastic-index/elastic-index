# GPU-Direct Example

This example demonstrates the use of GPU-direct with MCAS xxx_direct APIs to move data from MCAS
directly into and from the GPU memory space.  For the demonstration to work, the following are needed:

1. NVIDIA Tesla
2. CUDA installed
2. nvidia-peer-memory kernel module (https://www.mellanox.com/products/GPUDirect-RDMA)

GPU-direct attributes:
* very low overhead, as it is driven by the CPU. As a reference, currently a cudaMemcpy can incur in a 6-7us overhead.
* an initial memory pinning phase is required, which is potentially expensive, 10us-1ms depending on the buffer size.
* fast H-D (host<--mcas), because of write-combining. H-D bandwidth is 6-8GB/s on Ivy Bridge Xeon but it is subject to NUMA effects.
* slow D-H, (host-->mcas)because the GPU BAR, which backs the mappings, can't be prefetched and so burst reads transactions are not generated through PCIE

For the host-->mcas direction, DRAM buffer-bouncing can be faster.

## Run

Server side set up MCAS instance, e.g.:

``` bash
DAX_RESET=1 ./dist/bin/mcas --conf ./dist/conf/example-hstore-devdax-0.conf
```

Client:

``` bash
./dist/bin/gpu-direct-demo --server 10.0.0.101:11911
```

## Example output

Our test scenario includes:

* Tesla M60 GPU (Driver Version: 455.32.00)
* Intel Xeon E5-2630 (client)
* Intel Xeon Gold 5218 @2.3GHz with Intel 6x 512GB Optane Persistent Memory Modules (server)
* CUDA Version 11.1
* 2-hops on 100Gbps RNIC across SN2100 switch

Output is:
