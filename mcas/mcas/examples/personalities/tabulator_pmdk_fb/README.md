# Tabulator Example

Before using this example, PMDK must be installed (see https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/).

This example demonstrates the use of PMDK/fsdax in the ADO plugin.  It keeps
min, max, mean for ongoing puts of a numerical value.  The client is based
on Python and flatbuffers is used for the protocol.

## Configuration File

An example configuration file is given in dist/conf/tabulator.conf.  This 
configuration file uses fsdax (/mnt/pmem0).  Copy and edit if desired.

## Running Test

Server:

``` bash
USE_ODP=1 ./dist/bin/mcas --conf ./dist/conf/tabulator.conf
```

Client:

``` bash
./dist/bin/tabulator_test.sh <server-ip-addr>
```
