Zyre version 2.0.0 stable, released on 2017/01/20
=================================================

* v2.0.0 breaks API and ABI compatibility with the previous version.
  The ABI SONAME version has been bumped to 2.

* The current zyre and zyre_event APIs have been declared STABLE, and will
  no longer change in an backward-incompatible way until they are DEPRECATED
  and then RETIRED.

* The following backward-incompatbile changes have been made to the previously
  DRAFT APIs:

  - old: void zyre_version (int* major, int* minor, int* patch)
    new: uint64_t zyre_version (void)
  - old: zyre_event_type_t zyre_event_type (zyre_event_t *self)
    new: const char *zyre_event_type (zyre_event_t *self)

  The following symbols have been removed:

  - zyre_set_endpoint ( zyre_t* self, char const* format, ... )
  - zyre_shouts ( zyre_t* self, char const* group, char const* format, ... )
  - zyre_whispers ( zyre_t* self, char const* peer, char const* format, ... )
  - enum zyre_event_type_t

* The ZRE MSG class is now private and its symbols are no longer exported.

* The following new APIs have been added to the Zyre class:

  - zyre_set_evasive_timeout
  - zyre_set_expired_timeout
  - zyre_peers_by_group

  See doc/zyre.txt for more information.

* The following new APIs have been added to the Zyre Event class:

  - zyre_event_get_msg

  See doc/zyre_event.txt for more information.

* The zpinger program has a new option: -6/--ipv6, runs over IPv6.
  NOTE: needs support from CZMQ, will work only if Zbeacon supports IPv6.

* The examples/chat program is now building again.

* Many bug fixes. See git log on https://github.com/zeromq/zyre/commits/master
  for more information.
